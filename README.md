# Description
A simple implementation of a minimax algorithm and basic static evaluation function, done in the browser and on discord that I wrote in 2019. Currently only supports a 3 move look ahead, which usually results in 15-20 second calculation time, depending on board state. Play against the bot as if it was bullet chess (or else it might be too easy).

# TODO 
- Improve GUI
